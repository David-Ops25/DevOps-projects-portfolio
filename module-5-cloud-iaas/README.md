# Module 5 – Cloud & Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

This project demonstrates deploying a Java Spring Boot application on a cloud-based Linux server using Infrastructure as a Service principles.

## Technologies
- DigitalOcean
- Ubuntu Linux
- Java 17
- Gradle (Wrapper recommended)
- Spring Boot

## What Was Done
- Provisioned a cloud server
- Connected via SSH
- Installed Java 17
- Built the application using Gradle
- Created a non-root Linux user
- Ran the application on port 8080
- Verified deployment using curl

## Screenshots
Add your evidence screenshots into `screenshots/` and (optionally) embed them here.

## Notes about Gradle Wrapper
This package includes a *placeholder* `gradlew` and wrapper config to keep the portfolio structure consistent.
If you want the wrapper fully functional, run this once on your laptop (with Gradle installed):

```bash
cd java-react-example
gradle wrapper
```

Then commit the generated `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`, and updated properties file.
