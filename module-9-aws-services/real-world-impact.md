# Real‑World Impact (How this project maps to real DevOps work)

## Business problems this solves
- **Manual deployments** → replaced with repeatable, versioned automation
- **Environment drift** → container images ensure consistent runtime
- **Slow releases** → build/push/deploy in minutes, triggered by commits
- **Risky rollouts** → immutable tags + smoke tests reduce production incidents
- **Credential sprawl** → centralized, rotated credentials in Jenkins

## Where this pattern is used
- VM/EC2 based services (before or alongside Kubernetes)
- Teams standardizing deployments without rewriting infrastructure
- Organizations modernizing release practices while keeping proven tooling (Jenkins)

## Why it is recruiter‑relevant
It demonstrates:
- CI/CD ownership, not just scripting
- Practical AWS fluency (EC2/IAM/security)
- Containerization for reproducible delivery
- Troubleshooting under real constraints (permissions, keys, sockets)
